# Social Media Writer Skill

Plain text social media post explaining whatever user tells you to explain.
Check the latex file (.tex) of english and chinese if there are. Then create social media post explaining them in plain text.

You can use explanations from there, focus on explaining it in the same way, you might copy paste.

Make it not so short.

Do it in english, make a txt file, and then translate the txt file to chinese file as well, focus on keeping the same style andn tone of speech. Chinese version should have short title but it should describe the content well and accurately.
