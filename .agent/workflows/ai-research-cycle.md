# AI Research Adversarial Cycle

This workflow codifies the process of generating, stress-testing, defending, and finalizing a research proposal. It ensures that only mathematically sound and practically viable ideas proceed to implementation.

## Prerequisites
- An initial idea or theme provided by the user or generated by the `ai-research-innovator` skill.

## The Cycle

### 1. Innovation
Use the `ai-research-innovator` skill to generate a "V1" research proposal. This proposal should be mathematically grounded and address a specific problem in AI.
- **Output**: `[project-name].md`

### 2. Brutal Critique
// turbo
Invoke the `brutally-honest-critique` skill on the V1 proposal. The goal is to identify "fatal flaws," numerical instabilities, and computational bottlenecks.
- **Output**: `[project-name]-critique.md`

### 3. Proposal Defense
Invoke the `proposal-defender` skill to address every point in the critique. Do not just "patch" the idea; find technical "escape hatches" (e.g., changing kernels, using different solvers, applying regularizers) that make the idea viable.
- **Output**: `[project-name]-defense.md`

### 4. Chief Scientist Decision
// turbo
Invoke the `chief-scientist-decision` skill. Review the original proposal, the critique, and the defense to make a final adjudication.
- **Decision**: **[DROP]** (Shelve the project) or **[REVISE]** (Proceed to V2).

### 5. V2 Refinement
If the decision is **[REVISE]**, update the original proposal into a "V2" version that incorporates the "Mandatory Blueprint" from the Chief Scientist.
- **Action**: Update `[project-name].md` with the stabilized architecture and updated math.

### 6. Final
If the decision is DROP tell the user, if it's REVISE then present the V2 proposal to the user.
